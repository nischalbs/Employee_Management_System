Employee management is a practice that helps a manager improve employee productivity and satisfaction to help an organisation reach its goals. Human resources (HR) professionals often use an employee management system (EMS), including recruitment, offboarding and performance management to automate few procedures. Using a dedicated EMS can help an HR manager streamline the hiring process and improve workplace efficiency.
